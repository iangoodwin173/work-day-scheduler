## Workday Scheduler

This repository contains code for a workday planner/scheduler. It allows the user to input an event at a certain time during the day and have that event be saved when they return to or reload the page. The scheduler also has different colored time blocks denoting past, present, and future times during the day.

Below is an image of the deployed application, along with a link directing to said application.
